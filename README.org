* Learn Hydroflow

This repository provides a hands-on tutorial for learning about Hydroflow, a runtime for building fast and correct distributed programs presented at OOPSLA 2023.

Hydroflow introduces a dataflow based intermediate representation (IR) that enables safe optimizations like refactoring, replication, and partitioning for distributed systems. The formal foundations utilize semilattice theory to support deterministic concurrency and mergeable computation.

This tutorial provides:

An overview of Hydroflow concepts including the dataflow IR and semilattice model
A hands-on Hydroflow program example to run locally
Application of Hydroflow optimizations like refactoring and replication
Makefile, scripts, and instructions for building Hydroflow programs
After completing this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience with Hydroflow for building correct distributed applications.

The tutorial is based on the research presented in the OOPSLA 2023 Hydroflow paper. Please cite if using:
